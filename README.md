# PID-regulator
This project was implemented by my student Sui Shuaikai
The aim of this product is to perform the PID algorithm of temperature regulation, using the nanovoltmeter+thermoresistor as temperature measuring devices, curren cource+Peltier element as a heater/cooler.
This code was written using the LabVIEW package.
the PID algorithm is realised in c++
